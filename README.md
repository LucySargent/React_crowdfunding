<h2>Beebay</h2>
<p>Beebay is a crowdfunding app which enables people with sites for beehives, local bee-keepers and community supporters to share their collective resources.  
Bee-keepers can adopt a site. Community members can donate towards the cost of beehives on the site. The site owner gets a share of the honey!
It's a three-way partnership to support bee populations.</p>
